/*H************************************************************
*  FILENAME:      mmml.c
*  DESCRIPTION:   Micro Music Macro Language (Î¼MML) Player for
*                 AVR microcontrollers.
*
*  NOTES:         To be compiled with AVR C.
*
*                 A four-channel MML inspired 1-bit music
*                 player. Three channels of harmonic pulse
*                 wave and a percussive sampler or noise
*                 generator.
*
*                 Eight different duty cycles possible:
*                 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.125%, 1.5625%,
*                 0.78125% and 0.390625%. The 'thinner' pulse
*                 widths are perceived as a change in waveform
*                 power (volume) as opposed to a change in
*                 timbre.
*
*                 Tested on:
*                   * Attiny13/45/85 @ 8MHz
*                   * Atmega168/328  @ 8MHz
