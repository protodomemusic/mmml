In case you don't want to compile the code yourself (or design your own track management system) here is everything you need to create the 4000AD 'album-on-a-chip'. You can upload the hex file directly to an ATmega328 and it'll function as outlined here: https://protodome.com/4000AD/

I don't have a circuit diagram for the ATmega328 specifically, but you can find very similar schematics for an ATtiny here: https://phd.protodome.com/#anchor-musicbox

Enjoy!
